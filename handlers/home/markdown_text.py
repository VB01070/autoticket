# **What's New**

- Application Update Notification
- Using Gemini
- Fix deprecated flet components


# **To Do**

- Adjust the Test Details (the details on the keep secure 24 appear on one unique line, need to check if the break are in the right point.)
- Ai generate Management summary (from where to load the vulnerabilities? it would be easy probably to fetch them directly from the dashboard.)
- Publish migrate vulnerability, delete the migrated vulnerability from the market
- List of the most used Asset form GIS (need assistance from the team)
- Move presentation and report to drive


# **BUGS**

- The Migrate page does not reload properly
- Some error when reset button is pushed

# **Problem**

- The Desktop auth from google do not allow the application to access Drive. We need to authorize it. So load note from drive and move the report to drive is out of the book for the moment.

# **Ideas**

- Logs the event
