<p>This assessment was performed in accordance with the recommendations of the PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard) methodology. Other preventive measures from other standards such as the OWASP Testing Guide were also adopted to refine the methodology and reduce the risks intrinsically linked to the pentest activity.</p>
<p>The use of these methodologies makes it possible to undertake the pentest with a global vision of the problem, a "high level" approach independent of technologies used, which are constantly evolving, and to ensure that the tests are as exhaustive as possible.</p>
